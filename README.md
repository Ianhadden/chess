# chess

A 2 player chess program using all standard chess rules.
Commands are typed by giving the starting coordinates and
the ending coordinates. For example "a2 a4" will move lowercase's
pawn from a2 to a4. Pieces are represented by the first letter
of their name, with the exception of the knight, which is represented
by H or h (for horse).
