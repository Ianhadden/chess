# chess

A two player chess program conforming to all standard chess rules.
Commands are typed by giving the starting coordinates and
the ending coordinates. For example "a2 a4" will move white's
pawn from a2 to a4. Typing "rotate" or "ro" will rotate the board
180 degrees. Typing "auto-rotate" or "ar" will toggle auto-rotation,
which automatically rotates the board at the end of each turn.
